TOG, the millinery
==================

TOG is a simple implementation of an Hindely-Milner based type system for scentific Python programs, based on the great code sample from `Robert Smallshire <http://smallshire.org.uk/sufficientlysmall/2010/04/11/a-hindley-milner-type-inference-implementation-in-python/>`_.

More to come!
